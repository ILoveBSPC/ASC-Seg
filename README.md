- [2025.4.18] Training and inference code released

‚≠ê Abstract

Medical image segmentation plays a vital role in clinical workflows and treatment plans.
However, it faces two challenges:
First, the contour structures of salient objects and background details vary significantly in medical images of different modalities.
Second, the salient and non-salient objects often exhibit misleading co-occurrence phenomena and noise interference often exists at the segmentation boundaries.
To overcome these challenges, we propose ASC-Seg, a network designed to enhance medical image segmentation.
ASC-Seg adopts the Adaptive Structure Encoder (ASE) to capture the global structure and context of salient objects via parallel Mamba, and uses deformable learning to adaptively locate fine-grained contour details in complex backgrounds in medical images of different modalities.
Plus, our Cross-scale Noise Suppression Decoder (CNSD) uses noise suppression strategy and efficient attention mechanism to suppress noise introduced by non-salient regions and highlight critical salient regions, thereby enhancing the model's accuracy to distinguishing salient and non-salient objects.
Extensive experiments of ASC-Seg on 5 medical image datasets verify its superior performance and versatility, demonstrating its potential in the field of medical image segmentation.
